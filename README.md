![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-Welcome-green)

This repository contains a reading list of papers on **Time Series Forecasting/Prediction (TSF)** and **Spatio-Temporal Forecasting/Prediction (STF)**. These papers are mainly categorized according to the type of model. **This repository is still being continuously improved. If you have found any relevant papers that need to be included in this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request (PR) or open an issue.**

Each paper may apply to one or several types of forecasting, including univariate time series forecasting, multivariate time series forecasting, and spatio-temporal forecasting, which are also marked in the Type column. **If covariates and exogenous variables are not considered**, univariate time series forecasting involves predicting the future of one variable with the history of this variable, while multivariate time series forecasting involves predicting the future of C variables with the history of C variables. **Note that repeating univariate forecasting multiple times can also achieve the goal of multivariate forecasting, which is called _channel-independent_. However, univariate forecasting methods cannot extract relationships between variables, so the basis for distinguishing between univariate and multivariate forecasting methods is whether the method involves interaction between variables. Besides, in the era of deep learning, many univariate models can be easily modified to directly process multiple variables for multivariate forecasting. And multivariate models generally can be directly used for univariate forecasting. Here we classify solely based on the model's description in the original paper.** Spatio-temporal forecasting is often used in traffic and weather forecasting, and it adds a spatial dimension compared to univariate and multivariate forecasting. **In spatio-temporal forecasting, if each measurement point has only one variable, it is equivalent to multivariate forecasting. Therefore, the distinction between spatio-temporal forecasting and multivariate forecasting is not clear. Spatio-temporal models can usually be directly applied to multivariate forecasting, and multivariate models can also be used for spatio-temporal forecasting with minor modifications. Here we also classify solely based on the model's description in the original paper.**

## Some Additional Information.
ðŸš© 2023/11/1: **I have marked some recommended papers with ðŸŒŸ (Just my personal preference ðŸ˜‰).**

ðŸš© 2023/11/1: **I have added a new category ![Irregular_time_series](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Irregular-orange): models specifically designed for irregular time series.**

ðŸš© 2023/11/1: **I also recommend you to check out some other GitHub repositories about awesome time series papers: [time-series-transformers-review](https://github.com/qingsongedu/time-series-transformers-review), [awesome-AI-for-time-series-papers](https://github.com/qingsongedu/awesome-AI-for-time-series-papers), [time-series-papers](https://github.com/xiyuanzh/time-series-papers), [deep-learning-time-series](https://github.com/Alro10/deep-learning-time-series).**

ðŸš© 2023/11/3: **There are some popular toolkits or code libraries that integrate many time series models: [Time-Series-Library](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library), [Prophet](https://github.com/facebook/prophet), [Darts](https://github.com/unit8co/darts), [Kats](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Kats), [tsai](https://github.com/timeseriesAI/tsai), [GluonTS](https://github.com/awslabs/gluonts), [PyTorchForecasting](https://github.com/jdb78/pytorch-forecasting), [tslearn](https://github.com/tslearn-team/tslearn), [AutoGluon](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon), [flow-forecast](https://github.com/AIStream-Peelout/flow-forecast), [PyFlux](https://github.com/RJT1990/pyflux).**

ðŸš© 2023/12/28: **Since the topic of LLM(Large Language Model)+TS(Time Series) has been popular recently, I have introduced a category (LLM) to include related papers. This is distinguished from the Pretrain category. Pretrain mainly contains papers which design agent tasks (contrastive or generative) suitable for time series, and only use large-scale time series data for pre-training.**
